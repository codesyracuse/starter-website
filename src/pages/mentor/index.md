## Grow as a Developer: Hero Path Training

The training and mentoring we offer is about the improvement of skills as a developer or software engineer. Less like job training and more like gym training. Everyone wants to make progress, and there is only one way to do it: put in your reps. CODES provides structure and resources to help trainees on their learning path and mentors grow as developers and leaders.
