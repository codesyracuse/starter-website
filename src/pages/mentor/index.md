## Grow as a Developer

This is about the improvement of skills as a developer or software engineer. Less like job training and more like gym training. Everyone wants to make progress, and there is only one way to do it: put in your reps. 


* We help match mentors with trainees.
* Aim for 30 minute weekly or biweekly meetings, virtual or in-person. 
* We expect an initial 6-week commitment that can be extended.
* But you are under no obligation to continue with a specific person if it's not working out.
